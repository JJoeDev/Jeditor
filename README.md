# Jeditor
Jeditor is a CLI text editor based on the [Kilo](https://github.com/snaptoken/kilo-src/tree/propagate-highlight) editor from [this](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) guide

Currently it is just the finnished product from the guide, but I have plans to add more features to the editor
